# COVID-19-Transmission-Rates-Estimation

Data: This dataset is from Our World in Data. Every time you run this code block, you're pulling the most recent data.

What is the project about?

As we are having the data of the COVID-19 transmisssion rates on day to day basis, the main aim of the project is to build 
a hypothetical model for calculating the transimmison rates of the COVID-19 for the future dates using SIR epidemic mathematical
model.
